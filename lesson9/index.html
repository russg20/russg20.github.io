            <h3>A Rare Tornado Sighted in Soda Springs</h3>
            <p>A rare tornado touched down in Soda Springs on Sunday, October 13, 2019
                 causing minimal damage to the area.  We received reports from several residents
                  who saw the funnel cloud descend from the dark clouds above and touch down in a 
                 field near 2500 Road and Dekay Pit Road.  The tornado moved to the northeast at a 
                 speed of approximately 25 miles per hour and was on the ground for about 10 minutes 
                 before it dissipated, causing damage to several agricultural fields and ripping up 
                 trees in the area.  Luckily, no homes or structures were damaged, and no lives were 
                 lost in this freak storm, although it caused some hearts to race.  Albert Smith, a 
                 resident who was on a Sunday drive with his family, reported that he wasn’t sure what 
                 to do since he had never seen a tornado in the area before.  He said his heart was 
                 racing as he assessed the situation and tried to decide on a course of action.  
                 Ultimately, he drove in the opposite direction while his wife was taking pictures 
                 through the car window.  We are glad they are safe.  </p>
            <p>The National Geographic website states that “tornadoes form when warm, humid air collides 
                with cold, dry air.  The denser cold air is pushed over the warm air, usually producing 
                thunderstorms.  The warm air rises through the colder air, causing an updraft.”  
                Meteorologists in the Southeast Idaho area attributed the tornado to the unusually warm 
                weather Soda Springs was experiencing at the time.  If you are ever caught in a tornado 
                while driving, it has been suggested that you can try to escape by driving at right angles 
                to the tornado.  The best practice, however, would be to find shelter in a sturdy building, 
                or underground if possible.</p>
