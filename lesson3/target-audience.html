        <h3><u>Description of Target Audience:</u></h3>
        <p>The Weather-R-Us website was created to target those individuals in the Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven areas of Idaho who need a full and immediate forecast of the weather in those areas. 
            It is meant to be used by male and female individuals who are between the ages of 9 to 100 and who are familiar with weather conditions and phrases. 
        </p><br>
        <h3><u>Personas:</u></h3>
        <h4>Jerry</h4>
        <p>Jerry is a 52-year old dairy farmer who is married with four children. He holds a bachelor's degree in dairy science and owns a medium-sized dairy with approximately 500 cows.  His salary is around $45,000 per year. 
            Frequently throughout the day Jerry checks the weather on his phone or computer so that he can plan when to harvest his crops, when to open or close up the barn, when the field conditions will allow for farm equipment 
            access, and when to artificially inseminate his cows for appropriate birth months for the anticipated calves.
        </p>
        <h4>Kathy</h4>
        <p>Kathy is a 35-year old domestic engineer (AKA stay-at-home mom) who is married with two children, one of which has severe allergies. Kathy does not earn an income, however, her husband is a Mechanical Engineer and brings 
            in an annual income of $52,000. Kathy has a bachelor's degree in nursing, but has not worked in that field since her children were born. She references weather conditions on her phone throughout the day to know when it is 
            safe for her son to go outdoors and to regulate his medications.  Checking the weather also allows her to ensure that her children are appropriately dressed for current conditions.
